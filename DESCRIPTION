Title: ANEVA Dosage Outlier Test
Version: 0.1.1
Author: Pejman Mohammadi, Christina Sousa
Maintainer: Christina Sousa <sousa.19@osu.edu>
Description: This test is designed to detect if ASE data reveals sufficient imbalance
  to induce an outlier in total gene expression.
  The test takes in in two vectors of ASE count data from an R
  data frame, as well as a vector of population estimates for standard 
  deviations (sample estimates are provided). The output is a data frame 
  containing raw and adjusted p-values using Benjamini-Hoschberg method, 
  and a plot showing outlier data points in red.
